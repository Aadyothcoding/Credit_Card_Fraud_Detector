# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detector
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning approach. I have implemented a Logistic Regression model to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. The goal is to improve security by flagging suspicious activity in real-time, helping financial institutions protect their customers from fraud.

Project Overview

Credit card fraud has become a significant problem in the financial world. To address this issue, this project uses machine learning techniques to classify transactions based on historical data. The Logistic Regression model is trained on a dataset containing real transactions, identifying patterns and trends that differentiate between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

Key Features:
Binary Classification: Logistic regression is used to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Data Preprocessing: Includes scaling, encoding, and handling imbalanced data.
Model Evaluation: Performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Imbalanced Dataset Handling: Techniques such as oversampling and undersampling were used to address the class imbalance in the dataset.
Dataset:
The dataset used is publicly available and contains anonymized transaction details, including both fraudulent and non-fraudulent records.

Tools and Libraries:
Python: For the core implementation
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualization
NumPy: For numerical operations
How it Works:

Data Preprocessing: Raw data is cleaned and preprocessed. Features are scaled, and class imbalance is addressed using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE).
Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using key performance metrics to ensure accurate detection of fraudulent transactions.
Results:

The model performs well with high precision and recall on the fraud class.
The use of oversampling helped improve the model's performance on the minority class (fraudulent transactions).
Conclusion:

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective method to detect credit card fraud using logistic regression. While this project serves as a baseline, future improvements could include more sophisticated models like Random Forests or Neural Networks, as well as deploying the model in real-time environments for immediate fraud detection.
